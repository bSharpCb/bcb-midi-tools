            <h1>Hiya! Welcome to my personal site</h1>
            <p>Hosted on this page are several tools/projects I have worked on over the last few years.</p>
            <p>Each of these reflects my interest in some particular field or hobby:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Music theory</li>
                    <li>Percussion, guitar, piano, etc</li>
                    <li>Fighting Games / FGC</li>
                    <li>Education</li>
                    <li>Video production</li>
                    <li>Writing</li>
                    <li>Rhythm Games</li> 
                    <li>Programming</li>
                </ul>
            <p>In many cases, such projects will be a combination of multiple items on this list.</p>
            <p>I think it's easier to learn about things when you can make parallels to existing knowledge.(ask me about the parallels between jazz and fighting games)</p>
            <p>I hope these will be of use to you in some way. Feel free to contact me on Twitter/Email with any questions. Source code for most tools will be included on Github.</p>

            <p>P.S. as of 1/3/22, this page is still lacking SSL- unfortunately this means all webmidi compatible tools will not function currently :(
                I'll work on fixing this soon, but in the meantime you are welcome to download any tools from my Github for use on your local machine.
